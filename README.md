It is designed with a mobile-first mentality and follows a design provided in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1196874589259687769). The frontend is developed with a focus on creating a responsive and intuitive user interface. To achieve fluid transitions between screen sizes, the app utilizes custom CSS styles and the [EzClamp](https://github.com/AugustoBosa/EzClamp) app, developed by the project author.

To run the frontend application, make sure you have Node.js installed. Clone the frontend repository and follow the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section to set up the project.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitejs/plugin-react): A Vite plugin for React development.
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A fast development server and build tool for modern web applications.

For more information about each dependency, please refer to their respective documentation on npm.

Before running the frontend application, make sure to edit the `api.js` file and set the desired backend address using the default port 3333 or the one specified in the `vite.config.js` file.

To start the frontend application, use the `npm run dev` command. The application will be running on port 5173 (or the port specified in the `vite.config.js` file).
